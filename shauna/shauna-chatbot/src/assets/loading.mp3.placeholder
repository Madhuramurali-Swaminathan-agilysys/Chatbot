<!-- This is a placeholder for loading.mp3 -->
<!-- 
To add the loading music:
1. Find or create a gentle, soft background music file
2. Convert it to MP3 format (10-30 seconds duration)
3. Name it 'loading.mp3'
4. Place it in the src/assets/ directory
5. The AudioService will automatically load and use it

For testing, you can use any short MP3 file as a placeholder.

<!-- Temporary base64 encoded short beep for testing -->
<!-- You should replace this with an actual loading.mp3 file -->
